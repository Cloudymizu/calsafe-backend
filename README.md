# How to Setup Development Server for CalSafe:

# Attention!!
Currently, the main branch is supposed to be deployed onto Heroku. However, the localdev branch is currently the only one working on development on your computer. The main branch is still in the process of currently being deployed.

## You will need to Install:
  - PostgreSQL with GIS tools
  - Python
  - OS4Geo4W (For GDAL)
  - Everything in "requirements.txt"
  - Node.js

## Make a note of paths in /calsafe/calsafe/settings.py!
  - Set your "GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH =" to where you installed "gdal309.dll" within your OS4Geo4W path

## Make a note of the database username and password!
  - Name: "calsafe"
  - User: "postgres"
  - Password: "Fullerton"

## Initial Setup of Database:
  - I'm using pgAdmin to manage the database, I suggest you use it.
  - SQL table is provided for definitions
  - Use the importDB.py to populate the database with all crash data (It may take up to 10 minutes)

## Running the Website:
## Django is configured to run on localhost:8000/
  - To start Django, run the file "manage.py"
## Next.js is configured to run on localhost:3000/
  - To start Next.js, run "npm run dev" on the console
